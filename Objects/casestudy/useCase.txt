command-line notebook application
-Notes are short memos stored in a notebook. Each
-Note should record the day it was written and can have tags added for easy querying.
-It should be possible to modify notes. We also need to be able to search for notes.
-All of these things should be done from the command line
-The Notebook object has the list of notes as an attribute.
 It will also need a search method that returns a list of filtered notes.


 Folder Struct
-The menu interface should clearly be in its own module, 
since it will be an executable script,
-The Notebook and Note objects can live together in one module
